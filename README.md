# VarsInMem

Small program that prints its PID, then loads some variables (int, string, array of char) and some pointers and prints the memory addresses and values of these variables to the console.
This program is for educational purposes, I wrote it when writing a set of step by step tutorials on how to access another process' memory using the Windows API.
Ideal for someone learning to ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory.
